NOTE:

- Keep all the NON-UVM based Unit level testbenches within this folder.

- For a specific Unit to be verified 
	- Create a subfolder with the unit name - eg. \ALU_FU 
	- Keep the testbench related files within that subfolder.
	- for Questasim simulations - create '\sim' folder under the specific unit test folder.
	  eg: \ALU_FU\sim.
	- Use that folder as home directory for the specific project in Questasim.
