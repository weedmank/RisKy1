# EMU Folder

RV_EMU_core.sv       - RV32imc cpu emulator. Used for property verification where emulator cpu signals can be used to compare against the RTL RisKy1 cpu core
RV_EMU_params_pkg.sv - supporting package for RV_EMU_core.sv

These files are used in ../sva/RV_EMU_asserts.sv

These files are IP from a non-released Formal Property Verification project I am working on. However I am releasing a portion of the project as
encrypted IP for adaptation and use for debugging this CPU.
