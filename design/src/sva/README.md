FOLDER ORGANIZATION:

This folder contains System Verilog Assertions that can be used to verify the operation of the CPU.
These files are instantiated in the top level testbench file (see RisKy1/design/sim/risky1-core/top_tb1.sv)
and are bound to the RisKy1-core as follows:

```
   `ifdef BIND_ASSERTS
   Usable in Questasim
   cmd    DUT-module-name   module-name         instance-name ...
   bind   RK1               RV32imc_asserts     b1 (.*);
   bind   RK1.GPR           gpr_asserts         b2 (.*);
   bind   RK1.WB            wb_asserts          b3 (.*);
   bind   RK1.MEM           mem_asserts         b4 (.*);
   bind   RK1.EXE.CSRFU     csr_asserts         b5 (.*);
   `endif
```

- RV32imc_asserts.sv

   bound to the top level of the design RK1 (RisKy1-core.sv)
   
- gpr_asserts.sv

   bound to RK1.GPR (gpr.sv) which contains the CPU's Architectural Registers (X0-X31)
   
- wb_asserts.sv

   bound to RK1.WB (wb.sv) which is the Write Back Stage of the CPU 
   
- mem_asserts.sv

   bound to RK1.MEM (mem.sv) which is the Memory Stage of the CPU
   
- csr_asserts.sv

   bound to RK1.EXE.CSRFU (csr_fu.sv) which is the Control & Status Register module
   inside the Execute stage (execute.sv)

- pipe_asserts.sv

   not yet added...

Notice that all of these assertions can be turned on/off by whether or not BIND_ASSERTS
is defined.

Most of these are simple immediate assertions.  RV32imc_assserts.svp contains
hundreds of temporal property assertions that track instructions through the pipeline.
These assertions are generated by code based upon definitions (+define+ext_M  etc...)
during compile and also upon parameters found in RisKy1/design/src/pkg/cpu_params_pkg.sv
and logic in RisKy1/design/src/questa_formal/properties/RV32imc_model.svp.

RV32imc_model.svp and RV32imc_asserts.svp are IP from another project I am creating for
RV32imc Formal Property Verification (it is currently a non-released work in progress,
but I am allowing an encrypted portion of the project to be used to assist in Assertion
Based Verification of this open-source CPU)
