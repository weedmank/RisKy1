# RisKy1
 RISC-V ISA based 5 stage pipelined CPU (RV32IMC)

Once this project is downloaded, there will be a RisKy1 folder containing a design and verification folder.  To see a simulation run of a simple program, go to the RisKy1/design/sim/riscky1-core folder. This folder contains a Modelsim project file (RisKy1.mpf)  Using Modelsim or Questasim, open this project and run the simulation by typing "do top_tb1.do" Look at the contents of the .do file. Notice the top level testbench is top_tb1.sv. This testbench contains a simple code test that calculates and verifies the factorial of 4. It is written in both C and assembly and can be found in the instr_tests folder. Notice the testbench contains not only the RisKy1 CPU but also L1 instruction and data cache instantiations, as well as a model of a simple memory arbiter and system memory.  System memory holds the program that will be run.
